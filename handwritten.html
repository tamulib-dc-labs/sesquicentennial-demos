            As part of Texas A&M University’s 150th anniversary, the Libraries is exploring handwritten text recognition (HTR)
            methods utilizing LLM to expand access to our rich collections of handwritten materials. By applying
            advanced AI reasoning technologies, we aim to improve the discoverability, searchability, and usability of
            these historical documents, enabling new ways for researchers and the public to engage with A&M’s legacy.

            Below is a letter from T. M. Scott to J. R. Cole from the A.M.C. Early Presidents collection that will go
            live as part of our sesquicentennial celebration.

            While it may not look like much, this letter captures
            our university at a moment of profound institutional vulnerability, when its survival, identity, and mission
            were all under active threat. Written by T.M. Scott, the university’s agent in Austin, it appears on
            letterhead identifying A&M as the “Technical Branch of the University,” underscoring its contested and
            subordinate legal status, and is addressed to former president J.R. Cole, who had been forced out amid
            internal ideological conflict. Part apology and part political context, the letter reveals both the
            legislative battles being fought to keep the college open and the personal toll of those struggles,
            offering a rare, intimate primary-source view of A&M’s fragile early years.

            In transcribing the letter, Gemini not only produced an accurate and faithful transcription but also demonstrated a reasoning process that closely mirrors traditional paleographic practice. It correctly identified the document’s structure and reading order, preserved original quirks such as missing punctuation, and flagged areas of uncertainty with alternative readings.
